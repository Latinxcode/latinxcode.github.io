# About
Latinx Code was started as an evolution to the foundersâ€™ previous experiences in teaching Latina girls how to code. Our founders saw the need to include not only Latino boys, but children of any gender to STEM education.

We teach our students how to use technology to enrich their minds. Children can already think for themselves, we are merely helping them express their creativity so that they can achieve their goals.
